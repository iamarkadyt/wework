DB:
always populate user prop;
? parse date;
                

Front-end:
use IDs as list keys;
fix profile styling

[SKIP] scroll only overlay: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9280258/prevent-body-scrolling-but-allow-overlay-scrolling
[SKIP] Should overlay be within other forms too?
    Certainly should be for the modal window, but with forms the idea is that
    they may be used without one on smaller screens. 
[SKIP] Yup: output all errors for [social] schema. (mixed.withMutation(...)?)
[SKIP] Do not pass overlayId to modal? Let it have own one?
[SKIP] Pass form to generic modal component with buttons?
[SKIP] Use overlay inside of AddEdu and AddExp? Would be able to dismiss then, access overlayId?
[SKIP] Buttons together at the AddEdu & AddExp forms!

[DONE] add undefinize() method that would replace '' with undefined for all object properties.
[DONE] don't define form field variables in state to keep them undefined if unfilled
[DONE] add social form
[DONE] add modal (confirmation to delete)
    /***/
    <Modal onYes={...} onNo={...} question={...} />
    /***/
    Overlay within, OnBackdropClick knows what to do.
    /***/
[DONE] dismissOverlay OnBackdropClick
[DONE] add exp form
[DONE] restructure profileReducer: bring the profiles section to its own reducer, open usersProfile
[DONE] finish create profile form
[DONE] add edu form
[DONE] make Overlay component wrap whatever content it's being passed so that it's
    either centered to the screen or spread out like a long reddit-thread-style overlay.
[DONE] fix react-widgets styling
[DONE] wipe whole redux state onLogout
[DONE] status > title;
[DONE] grab user's profile and store it in the redux store
[DONE] error overwriting
[DONE] clean up error object:
    - completely, when profile is successfully fetched
    - only form errors otherwise
    NOTE: errors object is supposed to contain any errors that may occur 
        while interacting with current page. So wiping it out is fine in all cases. 
[DONE] delete redundant actions: + delete LOADING_* actions
[DONE] remove clgs
