[SKIP] Server polling for updates on feed content, stats, etc.
[SKIP] mark mandatory fields with asterisks
[SKIP] loading screen (reddit style: page filled with shapes of text fields)
[SKIP] Buttons together at the AddEdu & AddExp forms?
 
Known bugs and bad things to be fixed:
- Removing subscriptions and own posts from personal feed causes loading indicator to be shown and stuck.
  No request is sent to api server, endOfFeed stays undefined and isEmptyFn() returns false at Feed.js.
- Form errors persist between different forms and are not cleaned up properly.
- No server-side rendering, harmed (or almost absent) SEO as a result.
- Use of HashRouter.
