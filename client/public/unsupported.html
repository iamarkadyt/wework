      Dear users of older / deprecated browsers,
    </p>
    <p>
      Support for browsers like yours was not on my roadmap for this web application. Please accept my apology.<br>
      One of the goals of this project was exploration and research of bleeding edge web development technologies<br>
      and unfortunately your browser is way too old to be able to support some of them!
    </p>
    <p>
      Please visit this website from
        <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">Google Chrome</a>,
        <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Mozilla Firefox</a>,
        <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge">Microsoft Edge</a>
        or other, similarly modern browser.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once again, I apologize for this inconvenience.<br>
      Thank you.
    </p>
